        <h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to attempt to strengthen the social fabric on university campuses by enabling college students to easily coordinate activities like studying or leisure with their friends. The goal is to design an application that asks the user to indicate when they plan on studying and when they plan on enjoying free time throughout the week and shows the user how their plans compares with their friends.</p>
    

        <h3>DESIGN PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>Planning study sessions or leisure time with friends should be easy, but it’s not. In college, everyone is on different schedules between courses, extracurriculars, and other commitments. It can take several different messages between students just to find a time that works. I think this back-and-forth can be eliminated with an app concept that I’m calling Skedule. In the app, users would create a schedule of when they plan on studying or enjoying free time throughout the week, observe how their schedule compared to their friends, and make adjustments when desirable. The platform would also facilitate messaging between friends whose schedules overlapped, so that they could meetup and study or have fun together.</p>

        <h4>SCENARIOS</h4>
        
        <p>(1) On Sunday night, Ava mentally plans out the week ahead. Due to upcoming midterms, she knows that she can only afford to go out one night this week. Wanting to make the most of her only night out, she wonders which night of the week would allow her to see the most friends. She opens the app and selects the “browse friends leisure” option. She sees that on the Thursday evening, the highest number of friends have indicated leisure time. Having her answer, she clicks on the Thursday evening slot and selects “Join Activity”. She then returns to the dashboard to see her updated schedule.
        </p>

        <p>(2) It’s almost midday on Tuesday and Ava has plans to spend the afternoon studying, which she has previously entered into the app. Before leaving her apartment, she wonders if she can find some </p>
